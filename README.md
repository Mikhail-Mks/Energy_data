# Energy Data Analysis

This repository contains comprehensive analysis of energy data from 1990 to 2020, covering various aspects of energy production, consumption, and emissions. The data was sourced from Kaggle, and has been processed and visualized using Python and Power Query. You will also find a notebook that contains detailed explanations and insights from the data analysis.

Some of the key findings that you will discover in this repository are:

* China is currently the world’s largest emitter of CO2 from fuel combustion, surpassing the United States in 2006. While North America and Europe have reduced their emissions significantly in the past decade, China’s emissions have continued to grow rapidly.
* North America and Europe have also achieved the lowest CO2 emission factors across all regions, meaning they emit less CO2 per unit of energy consumed. This is mainly due to their shift towards cleaner sources of energy, such as natural gas and renewables.
* Central Asia and Eastern Europe have the highest level of energy intensity of their GDP, meaning they use a lot of energy to produce a given level of economic output. This indicates a low level of energy efficiency and a high dependence on fossil fuels.
* North America has increased its total energy production by more than 50% since 2006, becoming a net exporter of energy. This is largely due to its boom in oil and gas production from shale resources.
* Russia is the world’s largest producer of natural gas, accounting for more than 20% of the global production. However, it consumes only half of its production, exporting most of it to Europe and Asia.
* Norway has a remarkably high share of electricity in its energy mix, reaching more than 60% in 2020. This is mainly because Norway generates almost all of its electricity from hydropower, which is a renewable and low-carbon source of energy.
* China’s domestic consumption of coal and lignite is more than four times that of the United States. Coal and lignite are the most carbon-intensive and polluting sources of energy, contributing to China’s high CO2 emissions.


These findings reveal some interesting patterns and trends in the global energy landscape, as well as some opportunities and challenges for achieving a more sustainable and secure energy future.
