# Energy Data Analysis

This repository contains analysis of energy production, consumption, and emissions data from 1990 to 2020. The data includes CO2 emissions, energy production and consumption, share of renewables in electricity production, oil and gas production and consumption, and much more.

The data was obtained from Kaggle, and has been cleaned and formatted for analysis using the Python and Power Query. The analysis is presented in notebook, which includes Python code for generating visualizations and performing statistical analysis on the data.



## Key findings:

Key findings from the data analysis include:

* China is currently the largest contributor to CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, followed by the United States. While emissions have been declining in North America since 2006, China's emissions have been steadily increasing.
* North America and Europe have achieved the lowest CO2 emission factors across all regions, with significant reductions since 2001.
* Central Asia and Eastern Europe have the highest level of energy intensity of their GDP, meaning they consume a relatively high amount of energy to produce a given level of economic activity compared to other regions.
* North America has increased its total energy production significantly since 2006, suggesting a transition towards other sources of energy.
* Russia consumes only half of the energy it produces.
* Norway has a significantly higher share of electricity in its energy mix compared to other leading countries.
* Russia stands out as an outlier in terms of its natural gas production.
* China's domestic consumption of coal and lignite is significantly higher than that of the United States.


  
  
Power BI dashboard is also created for visualizing  data. The dashboard includes interactive charts and graphs that allow for deeper exploration of the data:
